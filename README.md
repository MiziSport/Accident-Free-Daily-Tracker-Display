# Accident-Free-Daily-Tracker-Display

Introduction: The accident-free daily tracker display device, originally crafted by German electronic dual vocational training students, faced a setback when its remote control went missing, rendering it inoperable and neglected in storage. Tasked by the Safety department to restore its functionality, we opted to upgrade its control system using Arduino Uno and ESP 8266 modules. This modification aims to re-enable remote control capabilities, ensuring the device's efficacy in promoting workplace safety.

Objective: To implement and maintain an accident-free work environment through the use of a daily display device that promotes safety awareness and encourages proactive risk mitigation among employees.
